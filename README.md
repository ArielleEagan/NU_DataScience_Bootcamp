1. Excel Homework 

## Background 
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Submission details 
    The excel sheet (".xlxs") shows the assignment, including requested new columns, pivot tables, and graphs to analyze the data. 
    The word document (".docx") gives the answers to the following questions from the homework main assignmet and bonus section:  
        1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
        2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
        3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
        Bonus 1: Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
        Bonus 2: Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
